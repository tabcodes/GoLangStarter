Rise and shine, Mr. Freeman. Rise and shine.

Not that I wish to imply you have been sleeping on the job-

No one is more deserving of a rest, and all the effort in the world

would have gone to waste until... well, let's just say your hour

has come again. The right man in the wrong place can make all

the difference in the world. So wake up, Mr. Freeman- wake up 

and smell the ashes.
